## 🧠 What Is This Project About?

The **Chatbot Archive Project** aims to create a central repository to store and process chatbot interactions in a structured format. By using CSV files, we ensure that the dataset remains accessible and easy to manage. The project includes tools for cleaning and analyzing the data, making it valuable for developers and researchers looking to improve chatbot performance.

### Key Goals:

- **Archive chatbot interactions** to track performance over time.
- **Analyze conversation patterns** to gain insights into user behavior.
- **Improve chatbot responses** through data-driven optimization.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The main dataset is stored in the `datasets` directory as a CSV file (`chatbots_dataset.csv`). This file contains structured records of chatbot interactions, including:

- **Timestamp**: Date and time of the interaction.
- **User Input**: The message sent by the user.
- **Bot Response**: The chatbot's reply.
- **Intent**: The detected intent of the user.
- **Sentiment**: The sentiment analysis result (positive, negative, neutral).

We aim to continuously update and expand the dataset as more chatbot conversations are archived.

## 📊 Notebooks

The `notebooks` directory contains the `process_data.py` script, which includes the following functionalities:

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize formats.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis on user inputs.
- **Intent Classification**: Identify user intents based on predefined categories.
- **Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs to visualize conversation trends.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-archive.git
cd chatbot-archive
```

Since this project doesn't currently have a `requirements.txt` file, install the necessary dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

Run the data processing script:

```bash
python notebooks/process_data.py
```

## 📈 Future Plans

- **Expand the dataset** with more chatbot conversations.
- **Enhance analysis tools** to include more advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- **Integrate a web dashboard** for visualizing data in real-time.
- **Add support for multiple chatbot platforms** (e.g., Facebook Messenger, Slack, etc.).
