# ProcessingVersion Directory - CubeAI

Welcome to the **ProcessingVersion** directory of the **CubeAI** project. This folder contains the original implementation of a Rubik's Cube solver created using **Processing (Java)**. This version showcases an interactive graphical representation of the cube and demonstrates solving algorithms in action

## üìÑ About the Processing Version
The **ProcessingVersion** was originally developed to provide a **visual and interactive way** to observe a Rubik's Cube solver in action. This version includes a graphical interface that tracks the cube's state, performs moves, and displays the solution steps visually.

The project was inspired by Code Bullet's groundbreaking work on RubiksCubeAI, utilizing **Processing** to create an engaging, educational, and entertaining AI project.

## üìä Key Features
- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch the cube's state change as the solving algorithm runs.
- **Algorithm Demonstrations:** See search algorithms like BFS, DFS, and heuristic-based approaches solve the cube step-by-step.
- **User Interaction:** Control the cube and observe how the solver reacts in real-time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run in Processing
1. Download and install the **Processing IDE** from [https://processing.org](https://processing.org).
2. Open the files from the **ProcessingVersion** folder in the IDE.
3. Click the **Run** button to start the visualization.
4. Observe the solving algorithm as it works through the cube's state.

## ü§ñ Solving Algorithms
The Processing version of CubeAI implements search algorithms such as:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Heuristic-Based Search**

Future plans include experimenting with more advanced solving methods and optimizing performance.

## üé® Customization
The graphical interface can be customized to adjust:
- **Cube Colors**
- **Animation Speed**
- **Camera Angles**

These adjustments can be made directly in the Processing code to enhance the user experience.

## üìà Future Enhancements
- [ ] Implement more efficient solving algorithms.
- [ ] Improve visualization quality and add new interactive features.
- [ ] Explore machine learning approaches for cube-solving.
