🔬 Acknowledgment

This project is inspired by the work of Code Bullet, who created the original RubiksCubeAI using the Processing (Java) framework. His project demonstrated a Rubik's Cube-solving AI that efficiently handled the cube's complexity using search algorithms and interactive visualization. His innovative approach, shared over seven years ago, sparked widespread interest in puzzle-solving AI and continues to influence developers today. We are deeply grateful for his contributions, which laid the foundation for further exploration. The original repository can be found here: https://github.com/Code-Bullet/RubiksCubeAI

## 🚀 Overview
CubeAI aims to provide:
- A **Lua-based Rubik's Cube solver** designed for **Roblox**.
- A **Processing (Java)** version to explore visualization and cube-solving algorithms.

The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of AI problem-solving methods, particularly search algorithms like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **Heuristic-Based Search**.

## 🧪 Lua Version (Roblox)
The **LuaVersion** folder contains the files required to run the project within the Roblox environment.

### 📄 Files:
| File                 | Description                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `CubeModule.lua`     | Represents the cube's state and operations. |
| `SolverModule.lua`   | Contains algorithms for solving the cube. |
| `MainScript.server.lua` | Main script to execute the solver in Roblox. |
| `UI/CubeUI.lua`      | Optional UI elements for visual representation. |

### ⚙️ How to Run:
1. Open Roblox Studio.
2. Import the scripts from the **LuaVersion** folder.
3. Run the **MainScript.server.lua** to see the solver in action.
